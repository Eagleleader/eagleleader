### Hi there 👋

My name is Jonathan and I'm a Microsoft tech Lover based in Luxembourg. 
During my free time, I write articles and I code application to always be aware of the new technologies features.

- 🔭 I’ve worked on complete digitalization of entire business application and echo systems
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning architecture of complex applications
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to .Net
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to Microsoft & Software Development
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can eat French fries each day ;)
