### Hi there 👋

My name is Jonathan and I'm a Microsoft tech Lover. I'm currently a CTO for a group company based in Luxembourg and Geneva. During my free time, I write articles and I code application to always be aware of the new technologies features.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning architecting complex applications
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to .Net
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to Microsoft & Software Development
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can eat French fries each day ;)
